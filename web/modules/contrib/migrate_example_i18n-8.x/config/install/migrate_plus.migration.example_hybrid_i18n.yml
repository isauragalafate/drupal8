# Migrate of nodes of type "story" from Drupal 6 to Drupal 8.
#
# This file demonstrates migration of content translated with
# the D6 'content_translation' module.
#
# The untranslated data for "story" nodes comes from 'example_hybrid_base',
# so refer to that before reading this.

  # The example_hybrid_base migrations has already created
  # untranslated nodes. We want to add our translation
  # to that existing node. How do we do that?
  #
  # The earlier example_hybrid_base migration identified each source
  # D6 node with its 'tnid' property. For each such node, it created
  # a D8 node, which has a 'nid'. Every time it did that, it recorded
  # a mapping between those values, eg:
  #
  # +-------------+-----------------+
  # | source_tnid | destination_nid |
  # +-------------+-----------------+
  # |      5      |       8         |
  # |      6      |       9         |
  # |      8      |      10         |
  # |     ...     |      ...        |
  # +-------------+-----------------+
  #
  # In the current example_hybrid_i18n migration, we use the 'migration'
  # plugin. This means: when you see a D6 source node, find its tnid,
  # and look it up in the table above. Use the resulting nid for the
  # destination node.
  #
  # For example, if a D6 node has tnid = 6, the migration will look it
  # up in the table, and find that the destination nid is 9. Then it
  # knows to add the translation to the node with that nid.
